# ImageTracking

## Description

- This app was created for me to test out how image tracking works.
- This app will detect a metro card and traider joes gift card and displays associated 3D models to it.
- I'm currently working on added location tracking and enable to display the 3D model only if the location matches.

## Challenges

- The most challenging part I'm facing now if to only show the 3D object when the image and the coordinates matches(This feature is in progress)
